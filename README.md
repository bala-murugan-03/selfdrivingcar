# SELF DRIVNG CAR
This project aims at developing a bluetooth control car with a self driving mode which can be turned on when needed. This project uses "Bluetooth Control 
RC Car", Android App for controlling the car via HC 05 bluetooth moodule. It also uses HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and it is programmed in a way that it would avoid the obstacles and takes a decision to turn right or left. The Android App used can also be built by the MIT App Inventor which gives us a flexibility to set the bluetooth responses from the app.
